You need to have the containers library installed:
http://coq.inria.fr/pylons/contribs/view/Containers/v8.4
All sources compiled with Coq version 8.4pl3 (February 2014)

After installing the containers library, type 

  make -j

to build the compiler LVC. This will generate a binary
  
	extraction/lvc

There are some example files in extraction/examples. 
Run one by issuing the following command:

  cd extraction
	lvc examples/foo.il
